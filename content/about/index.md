I'm a game developer passionate about creating engaging and interactive experiences. I specialize in building intuitive mechanics, dynamic systems and polished player interactions. I love creating games that feel unique in mechanics and story tellings. Adding small touches that make the experience much more memorable and enjoyable for players.

I specialize in Unity, but I also enjoy diving inot other engines like Unreal Engine to experiment, learn and discover new things and ways to bring my ideas to life.

Several games have inspired me to become a game crafter, titles like Okami, ICO and Rez showed me how games can move players emotionally and leave their mark on them, not just entertain them.

My objective is to create experiences that make others feel the same way I did when I first played those games. I want to evoke the same connection, wonder and excitement, and create worlds that players will remember long after they've finished them.
