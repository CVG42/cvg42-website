## About

Blueprint Studio is a roll and write game for 1 to 4 players where players take the ole of architects who have to draw the plans for a house and complete rooms with the right objects. Whoever designs the house with the highest value, wins.

I co-designed this board game with the talented [Alejandro Luna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuel-alejandro-luna-arce-2b27542a4/) as a college projecet. It was well received by our professors, José Macías and Ruben Hernandez, who offered us the opportunity to take it further and collaborate with Tabletop Workshops to launch a Kickstarter campaign.
